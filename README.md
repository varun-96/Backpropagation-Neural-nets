# Backpropagation-Neural-nets

Neural Network with backpropagation is used to classify the dataset,where Softmax funtion is used as an activation function.
Cross entropy was used to define loss function that quantifies the agreement between the predicted scores and the ground truth labels. We will then cast this as an optimization problem in which we will minimize the loss function with respect to the parameters of the score function.
